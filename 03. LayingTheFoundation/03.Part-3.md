## JavaScript Compilers: Understanding Babel.js

- **Overview**:
  - Babel.js is a popular open-source JavaScript compiler.
  - It offers a 'playground' where developers can experiment with their JavaScript code and see how it gets transformed by the compiler.

- **Key Functions**:
  - Transforms syntactically advanced JavaScript into backward compatible versions of JavaScript.
  - Converts JSX (JavaScript XML) into React function calls.

- **Example Conversion**:
  - If you write the following JSX code:
    ```jsx
    <h1>Namaste React</h1>
    ```
  - Babel.js converts it into:
    ```javascript
    React.createElement("h1", null, "Namaste React");
    ```

## JSX vs HTML: Knowing The Difference

- **Introduction to JSX**:
  - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, recommended for use with React to describe the UI structure.
  - It looks similar to HTML but has different syntactical rules.

- **Key Differences**:
  - **Class Attribute**:
    - In HTML, the class attribute is used to define classes:
      ```html
      <div class="group"></div>
      ```
    - In JSX, you must use `className` instead of `class`:
      ```jsx
      <div className="group"></div>
      ```

  - **CamelCase in Attributes**:
    - JSX encourages the use of camelCase for attributes that take more than one word:
      - HTML version:
        ```html
        <div tabindex="1"></div>
        ```
      - JSX version:
        ```jsx
        <div tabIndex="1"></div>
        ```

- **Exploration Task**:
  - Investigate how to convert traditional HTML tags and attributes into their JSX counterparts:
    - `<img src="image.png" />` in JSX remains the same but pay attention to other attributes like `className`.
    - `<a href="https://example.com">Visit</a>` is straightforward but confirm attribute casing and behavior in JSX.

## Homework Challenge:

- **Assignment**:
  - Explore various JSX attributes and how they modify the behavior of standard HTML tags within a React environment.
  - Experiment writing different HTML elements in JSX format, focusing on correct use of `className` and attribute naming conventions using camelCase.

These notes should give you solid insights and hands-on examples to understand complex concepts such as the conversion by JavaScript compilers and distinctions between JSX and HTML. This knowledge plays a crucial role during the coding interviews for a frontend developer position.
