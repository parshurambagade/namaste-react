# React and ReactDOM Basics

## Introduction to React Element and ReactDOM

React is fundamentally about building and managing elements in a web user interface, using JavaScript. Here's a breakdown of key concepts and examples to guide your preparation.

## React Elements

React elements are the smallest building blocks of React applications. They describe what you want to see on the screen. Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects and are cheap to create.

### Creating a React Element

A React element is created using:

```javascript
const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);
```

This code snippet creates an element resembling an HTML `<h1>` tag with the content "Hello, world!". React elements are immutable, meaning their children or attributes cannot be changed once they are created.

## Rendering Elements with ReactDOM

ReactDOM is the glue between React and the DOM. It offers methods for rendering elements into the DOM, updating them, and unmounting them when they are no longer needed.

### Basic Rendering with ReactDOM

To render a React element into the DOM, use `ReactDOM.createRoot()` and `root.render()` methods. Here's an example based on the content:

```javascript
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(element);
```

In this setup:
- First, we access a DOM node with `getElementById` which serves as the 'container'.
- `ReactDOM.createRoot()` is called with the container.
- The `root.render()` method is used to display the React element inside the container.

### Handling Dynamic Content

React efficiently updates the DOM to match the React elements. Consider this code snippet:

```javascript
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  root.render(element);
}

setInterval(tick, 1000);
```

This function creates a ticking clock which updates every second. React only updates what's necessary, showcasing its efficiency in handling dynamic content.

## Debugging Render Issues

### Placeholder: `not rendered`

When setting up dynamic content, use a placeholder like `'not rendered'` to manage errors or states where rendering fails. This practice makes it easier to troubleshoot issues when React cannot render components correctly:

```javascript
if (error) {
  root.render('not rendered');
}
```

By placing a 'not rendered' message, you can indicate a fallback state, which is highly useful during development and debugging.

## Key Takeaways

- **React Elements**: Understand that these are the core building blocks and represent the UI.
- **ReactDOM**: Familiarize yourself with its role in interacting with the DOM, especially methods like `createRoot` and `render`.
- **Efficiency and Debugging**: Recognize how React optimizes updates and how to debug when things go wrong using simple placeholders.

Mastering these basic but essential aspects of React will provide a sturdy foundation for any frontend developer interview.
