React Fundamentals
==================

Organizing React Code
---------------------

It's a good practice to organize React code into separate files rather than embedding it directly in HTML.

### Creating a Separate JavaScript File

Instead of writing React code inside script tags in HTML, create a new JavaScript file, e.g., `app.js`, and write the React code there.
```js
// app.js
const heading = React.createElement("h1", {}, "Hello World from React!");
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);
```

### Injecting JavaScript File into HTML

Link the JavaScript file in the HTML using the `<script src="app.js"></script>` tag to include the React code.

React Philosophy
----------------

React is built with a philosophy of manipulating the DOM using JavaScript, which provides powerful ways to interact with web pages efficiently.

### Optimization of DOM Manipulation

React, like other frameworks and libraries, aims to optimize the costly operation of manipulating the DOM. React encourages performing all web page interactions using JavaScript.

### Attributes in React Elements

React allows passing attributes to elements using an object. These attributes are defined within the object passed as the second argument to `React.createElement()`.

### Example:
```js
// Creating an H1 tag with attributes using React
const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "heading", XYZ: "ABC" }, "Hello World from React!");
```

Styling with CSS
----------------

Styling in React can be achieved by importing CSS files into HTML and applying styles to elements.

### Importing CSS File

Create a CSS file, e.g., `index.css`, and import it into HTML using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css">`.

### Example:
```css
// index.css
#heading {
    color: red;
}
```   

Understanding React Elements
----------------------------

In React, elements created using `React.createElement()` are JavaScript objects representing DOM elements. They are not actual HTML elements until rendered.

### Rendering React Elements

The `ReactDOM.render()` method is responsible for converting React elements into actual DOM elements and rendering them onto the web page.

### Example:
```js
// Rendering React element onto the web page
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(heading);
```    

Conclusion
----------

Understanding the basics of React organization, DOM manipulation, attributes, styling, and rendering lays a strong foundation for further learning and building complex applications with React.
