Part-01: Introduction to React
==============================

Setting Up Development Environment
----------------------------------

*   Google Chrome and VS Code are recommended for this web series.
*   Using Google Chrome Developer Console for debugging.
*   Install Google Chrome and VS Code if not already installed.

Creating a Basic HTML Page`
--------------------------

*   Start with a basic HTML file structure.
*   Use HTML tags to create a simple "Hello World" program.
*   Utilize VS Code's Emmet abbreviation to quickly generate HTML code.
*   Basic HTML structure includes `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.
*   Use `<script>` tag to include JavaScript code within HTML.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
Injecting JavaScript into HTML
------------------------------

*   Create a heading element (`<h1>`) using JavaScript's `document.createElement()` method.
*   Set the innerHTML of the heading to display "Hello World" using `heading.innerHTML = "Hello World";`.
*   Insert the created heading into the HTML document using `document.getElementById()`.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Hello World Website</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 id="hello"></h1>

    <script>
        // JavaScript code to inject "Hello, World!" into the <h1> element
        document.getElementById("hello").innerText = "Hello, World!";
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```
Introduction to React
---------------------

*   React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
*   Include React in the project using CDN links or package managers like npm.
*   CDN links provide access to React's core framework and DOM operations.
```javascript
//react.development.js
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>

//react-dom.development.js
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
```
*   React enables developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage the DOM.

Exploring React's Superpowers
-----------------------------

*   Injecting React into the project provides access to React's functionalities and methods.
*   Accessing React's features through browser console reveals secret internal functionalities.
*   React's core file (`react.development.js`) provides the foundation for React's algorithms and functionalities.
*   `react-dom.development.js` serves as a bridge between React and the DOM, facilitating DOM manipulation.

Conclusion
----------

Understanding how to set up a development environment, create basic HTML pages, and integrate React into projects is essential for frontend development. React provides powerful tools for building interactive and efficient user interfaces.
